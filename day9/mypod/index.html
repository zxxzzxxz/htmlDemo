    <h1>Welcome to myPod</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the place to show off your ipod, wherever you might be.
        Wanna join the fun? All you need is any iPod from the early classic
        iPod to the latest iPod Nano, the smallest iPod Shuffle to the largest
        iPod Video, and a digital camera.

    <h2>Seattle, Washington</h2>
    <p>
        Me and my iPod in Seattle! You can see the Space Needle. You can't see the 628 coffee shops.
